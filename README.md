## About

I design and build end-to-end data and AI systems — from raw data ingestion and feature engineering to model deployment and business insight generation.

My work spans:

- Machine Learning & Predictive Modeling
- Generative AI Systems (LLMs + Retrieval)
- Time Series Forecasting
- Business Intelligence & Analytics
- Mobile + Backend ML Integration
- Core Systems Programming

I focus on practical, production-oriented solutions rather than isolated notebooks.
